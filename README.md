## Introduction
Code repository for Realtime Chat Application from tutorial. Using  React on the front end, with NodeJS and Socket.io web socket library on the back end. 

This project gave me a good understanding of how to send and receive messages using web sockets to make a real-time application.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server.
